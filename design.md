# Lab 1: Task Manager App
**Group members:** Emily Zhang, Christopher Chung, Olina Wong

For Lab 1, we aimed to design a modern, simple interface for a mobile web app that functions as a task manager.
The app handles various tasks including creating, renaming, and marking items as well as showing uncompleted items and deleting completed items.
For final screen images and flows for each task, see the bottom of this design doc.

### Design Decisions
*Decision 1: Creating a toolbar at the bottom of application*
- Hello

*Decision 2: Hello*
- World

*Decision 3: Cohesive Color Scheme*
- 

### Alternative Designs
The following are some alternative design ideas that we considered:
- **Position of the Add Task input box and button:** We considered putting the add task button at the bottom of the list or having it off to the side rather than the top.
- **Tool bar at bottom of page:**

### User Testing
We did some user experience research by asking 4 friends to navigate through our app's screen images while performing some of the tasks. For example, we asked them to talk out loud as they walked through what steps they would take to add a task or rename a task. We iteratively changed our design to ensure that the app was intuitive and clear in what functionalities it performed.

We also asked some of the following specific questions:
- Where would you rather have an "add task" button be located?
- What are some important must-haves for a to-do list manager app?

### Challenges
The following are some challenges that we faced:
- Deciding what order to approach the design process
-

### Parts Weâ€™re Proud Of
- Iteratively walking through the design process
-

### Final Design
Below you will find the screen images and flow for each task.
